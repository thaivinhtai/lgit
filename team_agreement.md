1. The name of the team: Irresponsible-2-members-Company Lgit
2. The working hours/days each member commits to: 4 hours/days
3. How often check-in with each others' progress: once a day
4. The strengths and weaknesses of each member, and how to leverage/mitigate
   them for the project, the allocation of the workload:
   4.1. ttai97:
    a. Strengths:
      - Have ability in coding with lean and logical structure
      - Self-learning about new things
    b. Weaknesses:
      - Make too much colorful stuffs
   4.2. dthilieu:
    a. Strengths:
      - Test and review code
    b. Weaknesses:
      - Not have much knowledge about coding with structure
   4.3. How to leverage/mitigate them for the project, the allocation
        of the workload:
      Base on these strengths and weaknesses, we decide to leverage/mitigate
      them and allocate workload as well as below:
        - ttai97 will code the main structure of the project, cover as much
          case as he can.
        - dthilieu will test these functions, fix bug if any or work with
          ttai97 to fix bugs, make sure code design is okay.
5. Strategy so that all members understand the codebase:
  ttai97 will code and dthilieu will read code accordingly, in case of any
  point that need to clarify, both members will work on this point and make
  sure it is clear for both.
